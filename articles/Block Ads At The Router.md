Ads have taken over most of my small 4 inch iphone screen!<br /><br /><div style='display:flex;justify-content:center'><br /><br /><img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bangequal-media/BlockAdsImg3.jpg' /></div><br />To make matters worse, I scroll down one time and they kill me with a MODAL AD.<br /><br /><div style='display:flex;justify-content:center'><img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bangequal-media/BlockAdsImg2.jpg' /></div><br />OK time to fix this problem. But how?<br /><br /><ul class='fa-ul'><li><i class='fa-li fa fa-circle' style='padding-right:1rem'></i> Ads are blocked on my laptop using an extension on my browser called adblockplus. They have an app for iphones that costs less than $2.</li><br /><li><i class='fa-li fa fa-circle' style='padding-right:1rem'></i> It would nice to get rid of ads on all the devices in my house not just my phone, like kid's tablet, wife''s phone, fire stick, etc.</li><br /></ul><br />  
        <span style='font-size:x-large;font-weight:bold;'>Try One</span><br /><br />  
        1. First I started reading into Pi-Hole. Its a DNS service that can be configured to run 24hrs on my RaspberryPi. Its supposed to blocks ads before they are downloaded, so it can actually speed up the network.<br /><br />2. How about we just throw money at the problem? I found a $99 device called adtrap that is supposed to bring me nerdvana.<br /><br />3. A few years ago I installed custom firmware on my wifi router, just a regular old router purchased from Walmart. I chose to flash DD-WRT over Tomato for obvious reasons. At the time, my idea was to run a VPN service directly on the router, but alas I could never get it to work. Now, if there was only a way to program the router to block all unwanted traffic leveraging the DD-WRT firmware to run a linux script on startup.<br /><br />

        <div style='display:flex;justify-content:center'><img src='https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bangequal-media/BlockAdsImg3.jpg' /></div><br />I really wanted to try #1 but decided on #3 instead. It turned out to be the right choice considering how quickly I was able set it up, thanks to <a href='http://www.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=1039456'>this</a> forum thread.  Basically, you give the wifi router a list of domains of known ad servers, then just block them. Of course you have to keep your list up to date, but that can be rolled into the script.
