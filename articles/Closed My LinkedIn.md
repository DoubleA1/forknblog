Lately, I seem to be obessing over online privacy and digital security. Whenever news comes out about another personal data breach or security vunerability, I am blown away by the possible ramifications against an unsuspecting public. My paranoia led me to conduct an online self-background check recently, the technical term for which is OSINT (open source intelligence).

<br/>

#### OSINT

<br/>

There are many techniques one could use when collecting information about a person, some border on nefarious. I limited my scope to people search websites. I do realize public information tied to my name exists, such as tax records and birth records. Sites like Spokeo, which specialize in people searches, could easily grab data from my county website and post details such as my address or date of birth. I was suprised, however, to find more information than I had anticipated. My lifes facts were neatly and accurately layed out for public consumption and the primary source of this data leak was Linkedin

#### Search Someone

<br/>

Go to [pipl.com](www.pipl.com) and complete the form.<br/>
<br/>
Personal data points vary from one person to another. Someones age or past cities of residence are quite common, as are telephone numbers and login usernames. If the target posesses a LinkedIn account, we can see their work history, educational history, and a picture. Its like generating a free, detailed report anonymously in seconds!<br/>
<br/>
My immediate reaction was to look for 'removal' or 'opt-out' instructions. Opt-out is available on the other popular people search websites, alas, Pipl.com is different. Instead of collecting the data themselves, Pipl points you to the information found elsewhere online, they are simply the messenger. The message is coming from a leaky source like Linkedin. In order to remove data from Pipl, I need to cut the leak first.<br/>
<br/>
I logged into LinkedIn and sure enough they were being allowed to transmit my profile data. In privacy settings, my public profile visibility was set to everyone. Pipl.com likely pulls its data from these public profiles, but can I be sure? My personal information was never going to be private in the hands of a multinational corporation anyway, so adios
